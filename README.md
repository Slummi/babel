# Strongbox Babel
This is the repository for contributing to translation and localisation for Strongbox! Please read the CONTRIBUTIONS.md file before you contribute. 
**Note**: It is no small task as there are upwards of 6,000 words in the project, so please only take this on if it something you feel you can do a good job on and bring to completion. I don't want to release a localised Strongbox which is only half way there, so please make your contribution comprehensive. Thanks!

# How to contribute for your Language
If you'd like to have Strongbox translated into your language and are willing to do so under the terms of the MIT licence then please follow the steps below:

1. Get in touch with me (support@strongboxsafe.com) or simply open an issue above and we can discuss.

2. Once you're happy with your contribution, submit a pull request with your changes. I'll review and make sure they won't crash or otherwise cause any trouble with the Strongbox.

3. If you come across any issues, or problems with existing contributions, or if you can't find a particular string then just create and issue here in this repository and hopefully we can resolve things quickly and amicably.

4. All going well, I should be able to take the work you've contributed here and integrate it into the main app.
